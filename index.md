One of the most generalist and probably the slowest problem solving techniques in computer science, the brute-force search. It might be slow, but it certainly works! 

This is an attempt to not *just* be another tech blog. This is a collection of all my learnings as a programming and software developer over time. These learnings are presented in a brute-forced (aha!) manner i.e. no TL;DRs here unfortunately.

Do head over to the blog section to scroll through a chronological ordering of articles. If you're curious about yours truly (ahem!), head over to the about section instead.
