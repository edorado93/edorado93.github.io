I invested a lot of time coming up with these points and putting my thoughts to words. Hope you are able to take away some good stuff from this and hope this helps you out !!</p><h3 name="fbb0" id="fbb0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Life is NOT a Race</h3><p name="140c" id="140c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The most important point that we don’t realize is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">life in fact is not inherently a race. It is we who make it a race and bring about this feeling of competition. </strong>Right from the time we were born, we were taught that we need to come first. First in class, first in sports, first in extra curricular activities etc. We are in a constant state of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">comparison with our peers.</strong> In this process we actually limit our potential.</p><p name="1bbc" id="1bbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let me cite a simple example. Suppose the highest percentage in a class is 85 % and a kid gets say 87 %, his parents will be elated with his performance for the sole reason that came <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">first.</strong> What we don’t realise is that he probably had the capability to score 90+. And in case the maximum potential for our kid is say 75 % and despite that he gets a 77 %, we tend to scold him. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Why ? </em></strong>because there is a student who performed better than him. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">FREAKING COMPETITION !!</em></strong></p><p name="a087" id="a087" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We take this sense of competition everywhere we go. People can compete on just about anything. Consider this. There are two families A and B. when family A visits B, B makes about say <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5 dishes for lunch. </strong>(And yes, this is in fact counted !!). Now family B happens to visit A in the future and in case A makes lesser number of dishes than what B made, then it is considered to be a sign of disrespect. Trust me, this happens. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Shit like this does happen. :(</strong></p><blockquote name="9cc4" id="9cc4" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Life is like a car ride from a source to a destination. No matter how fast you go and who accompanies you, you will reach your destination. People will keep getting in and getting off of your car as you continue down your lane. Some people will be driving their cars at a higher speed than you. Do not pay any heed to them because if you happen to beat one person, there will always be another one to beat and in case you become the best (i.e. the fastest in this case), you will always have the insecurity of maintaining your position at the top.</blockquote><p name="3f79" id="3f79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">So stop competing with others and instead focus on building your abilities. Focus on building stronger relationships and living life to the fullest because Hey, YOLO !</p><h3 name="9611" id="9611" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Relationship or Business ?</h3><p name="692e" id="692e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A lot of problems in our lives are there because of a lot of expectations we have from our friends and family members etc. Let me give you a very simple example of how <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">expectations ruin relationships.</strong></p><p name="ddcf" id="ddcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A very naive example where expectations destroy relationships is a common neighbourhood scenario. We decided to help our neighbours by helping them organising an important family function. Helped them with preparation, invitations and stuff. Roles reversed, the same did not happen. The neighbours were disinterested in helping us out and we develop a grudge against them as we <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">expected them to pay back. Sad but true !</strong></p><p name="0a69" id="0a69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s a very big problem in relationships. We give loads of love, but we also expect a lot of that coming back. We expect a lot of stuff from a lot of people and that is where it all goes wrong. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Relationships simply mean give, give and only give. Business means give and take. Its upto you to decide what you consider it to be.</em></strong></p><h3 name="225e" id="225e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Who is the real us ?</h3><p name="b2c3" id="b2c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A typical professional’s day appears to be one that has literally been programmed into their memory. He does the same things over and over again, in the same manner, in the same sequence and still knows that what he is doing is probably <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">shitty and is still willing to do that for years at a stretch.</em></strong> The life of a typical IT guy is somewhere on these lines :-</p><ol class="postList"><li name="6682" id="6682" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Get up (Same time everyday).</li><li name="59fa" id="59fa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Prepare breakfast (Same old same old. No surprises here :p)</li><li name="7dea" id="7dea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reach office round about 9 a.m. Every single day without a leave.</li><li name="98e3" id="98e3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Work your ass off the entire day for 12–13 hours at a stretch. He probably doesn’t even love the work he is doing, but still does it.</li><li name="ad8b" id="ad8b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Toady to your manager.</li><li name="e124" id="e124" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Come home late night exhausted from work.</li><li name="b30d" id="b30d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Sleep. Well this was a no brainer !!</li></ol><blockquote name="7a63" id="7a63" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--li">This seems to be a script fed to a <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">ROBOT and he executes it every day without any exceptions.</strong> But who is the real us? The one that we put on when we go to work everyday amidst the pressures of our everyday life, or the one we display when we are jumping around in the rain with our friends?</blockquote><p name="3826" id="3826" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Pay a small attention to this.Take a break from this monotonous routine and you might be surprised with what you find. You will realize that you have been a part of the wrong race this whole time and that you need to participate in a different race moving forward and in that race you won’t be mediocre any more.</p><h3 name="88b5" id="88b5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Empathy</h3><p name="a3fb" id="a3fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In our day to day lives performing the same laborious mundane tasks over and over again can be extremely overwhelming. So much so that we always try to find an answer to the question</p><p name="2eba" id="2eba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“What’s in it for me ?”</em></strong></p><p name="736c" id="736c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We always look for opportunities that would benefit us. In the process we even tend to hurt others and if someone is facing a problem or has a contrasting viewpoint, we tend to go all out against them and criticise them for being different. My suggestion ?</p><blockquote name="7684" id="7684" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Step in the shoes of the other person and try walking a mile. Be empathetic to them. Try being an altruist. Prove the cynical ideology of people wrong by understanding other’s viewpoints as well and understanding them and at times even accepting them without letting your ego get in the way.</blockquote><h3 name="8707" id="8707" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">Crave for Knowledge and not Money</h3><p name="4fb6" id="4fb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">From what I have seen and form my interactions with my peers, I have found out that 90% of times the reason for happiness or the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pain in the arse </em>behaviour or switching a company is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MONEY.</strong></p><blockquote name="8959" id="8959" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I’m not being paid enough. I have had a lot of impact.</blockquote><blockquote name="df05" id="df05" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Had I a strong family business, I would never be a part of this industry.</blockquote><blockquote name="1119" id="1119" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--hasDropCapModel graf-after--blockquote">The only reason I’m into this field is because it pays off.</blockquote><p name="f15d" id="f15d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I’m surprised that no one ever mentions their passion for what they are doing. Never heard someone tell me that money is second nature for them, what’s more important is the quality of work they get. The sought of stuff they work upon day in and day out. Why does it always have to be about money ? Why can’t we instead invest in our skills and crave for knowledge as much as we crave for money and fame ?</p><h3 name="82b5" id="82b5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Health is …..</h3><p name="8895" id="8895" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For us Software Developers, spending hours at a stretch in front of a computer screen is completely normal. If you work at a startup, the stress levels and the time you spend in front of a screen is even more. Because of this, a lot of us suffer from back pains and stiffness and various other types of maladies.</p><p name="6efa" id="6efa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Still, we don’t pay much heed to our health. Health somehow does not become a priority for us. There is always something better to do than exercising or shaping up our body.</p><p name="2ce4" id="2ce4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is only when the Doc tells us <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Enough. If you don’t exercise now, you might be bedridden for life !! “ </strong>do we start to consider this thing called health seriously. I mean if you can’t get off the bed in the morning yourself, how will you work all day long ? Who will take care of you in your old age when things will get even worse ? You will end up spoiling your job, relationships and everything you once loved will flush down the toilet because ? (No points for guessing !!).</p><p name="cff6" id="cff6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Health is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Wealth</em></strong>. Period !!</p><h3 name="da7b" id="da7b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Travel</h3><p name="f4e8" id="f4e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">One of my favourite topics. Could write about this for hours and still not get bored. The phrase <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">You only live once. Live life king size </strong>and the stuff, are boring clichés in today’s time. We have heard this about a thousand times or more in our lives but still we keep living the same monotonous lives. We always think about vacations but somehow this is something that keeps getting postponed.</p><p name="6c57" id="6c57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are never able to gather enough funds and find out a suitable time to escape into paradise (Well that’s really what travel is). I’ve stumbled upon so many blogs and articles here on Medium itself and I can’t emphasise enough the fact that travelling is something that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">rejuvenates us, rekindles us from the ground up, gives us a new perspective on life, reenergises us, helps you shun off the diffident you and add life to your lifeless life !!</strong></p><p name="f229" id="f229" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently I have been reading about this new kind of job profile for us Software Devs and its known as a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Digital</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Nomad. </strong>A digital nomad is like a normal developer except he does not stay at one place for a long time. Instead, he keeps moving from one place to other like a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">nomad. </strong>Learning about problems people face, building solutions for them and most of all, travelling a lot.</p><p name="f796" id="f796" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sounds fun right ? Do you have what it takes to quit your day job and become a Digital Nomad ?</p><h3 name="b972" id="b972" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Stop asking “Why me ?”</h3><p name="b123" id="b123" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Life is a complete roller coaster ride. It almost never proceeds according to our expectations. Life is never what we want it to be. Someday we are elated and on cloud 9 as something happened unexpectedly and someday we are down and feeling as if it is the end of life for us.</p><p name="1dd7" id="1dd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we are down, and I mean utterly depressed or something, we do tend to ask this one question from God and that is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Why me God ? Why ? What have I done to deserve this ?” </strong>We almost never get an answer to this question and with time our wounds heal (or at least we forget about them). I would urge you to stop obsessing morbidly over this. Let me quote a small excerpt I found on some blog :-</p><blockquote name="6a18" id="6a18" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Arthur Ashe, the legendary Wimbledon player was dying of AIDS which he got due to infected blood he received during a heart surgery in 1983.</blockquote><blockquote name="901b" id="901b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">From the world over, he recieved letters from his fan, one of them conveyed: “Why does God have to select you for such a bad disease?”.</blockquote><blockquote name="0572" id="0572" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">To this Arthur Ashe replied: The world over — 50,000,000 children start playing tennis, 5,000,000 learn to play tennis, 500,000 learn professional tennis, 50,000 come to the circuit, 5000 reach the grand slam, 50 reach the Wimbledon, 4 to semi finals, 2 to finals.
