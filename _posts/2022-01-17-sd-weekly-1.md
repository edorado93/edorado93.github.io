  title: Surprises in our NoSQL adoption survey
  description: Today we shared some results from a survey we conducted a few weeks ago to assess the current state of NoSQL adoption. Though we originally ran the survey to gather data for planning purposes, we found the data so interesting (and, being honest here, positive) that we wanted to share it.

  title: Introducing Espresso - LinkedIn's hot new distributed document store
  description: Espresso is LinkedIn's online, distributed, fault-tolerant NoSQL database that currently powers approximately 30 LinkedIn applications including Member Profile, InMail (LinkedIn's member-to-member messaging system), portions of the Homepage and mobile applications, etc.

article_three:
  title: Why You Should Never Use MongoDB
  description: I’ve picked the wrong database a few times. This is a story about one of those times — why we picked it originally, how we discovered it was wrong, and how we recovered. It all happened on an open source project called Diaspora.

The day is finally here when I start journaling about what I'm studying on a day-to-day basis. If you want to know more about what resources I'm currently working with and what template I follow for putting together the notes in this System Design journal, read the [introduction](/sd-daily-introduction) blog.

## Brief Overview

* Starting with the second chapter from [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/)

## Takeaways


## Interesting Articles

### The survey conducted by Couchbase on NoSQL adoption 

{% include article articleid="article_one" %}

Great article that highlights the survey results conducted by the popular NoSQL database, Couchbase, in 2012 around the adoption of NoSQL technologies.

### Espresso, LinkedIn's distributed document store

### Why you should never use MondoDB

This is a really great article to see why the idea of "flexibility" seems very shiny on the surface but when you really get down to it, you realize it is not as flexible. Here are some of the key points that the article talks about:

- The application itself and how it came into being -- Diaspora.
- The essential working of a "distributed" social network. What makes it different from a single server social network like Facebook.
- How MongoDB is an ideal solution for storing (and retrieving) the data for TV-shows.
- Why, on the surface, the social-network data, especially the activity feed data looks very similar to that of the TV shows data.
- Eventually, the Diaspora team realizing the troubles with the way this data was being stored. Since there are relational connections *between* components, there is no *easy* way of piecing data together for displaying on the timeline.

- One of the hardest problems to solve in computer science -- cache invalidation.
- Why cache invalidation would matter a lot in the case of social feed's data.
- > The realization that the Diaspora team were using a cache as a database.
