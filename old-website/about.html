        <img src="/assets/about-me-image.png" style="float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%"> I'm a second year student pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at the <strong>University of Southern California</strong>. My research interests are in the application of <strong>Sequence to Sequence models to the task of Language Generation</strong>. I got my first exposure to these areas when I joined the Information
        Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California as a Student Research Worker. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been working under the guidance of <strong>Prof. Premkumar Natarajan</strong> for over a year now. Currently, I am a summer intern at ISI where I am working on the task of <strong>Neural Abstract Generation using Sequence to Sequence Modelling</strong>. The idea is given a title as an input along with some additional context, the system should output a well formed, coherent, diverse abstract. Right now, the project focuses on the scientific domain but the applications of such a system can be enormous. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Prior to joining USC for my Masters, I worked as an <strong>Software Developer at Hike Messenger</strong>, one of the largest consumer tech companies of India. As a member of the infrastructure team, I familiaried myself with a vast array of distributed systems and related technologies working at scale. I developed and worked on a a bunch of microservices and was a part of some major refactorings of critical system components. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My work experience has helped me in understanding the intricacies involved in developing critical and time-intensive software that supports millions of users on a daily basis and my research experience is providing me in-depth knowledge of Deep Learning and its applications to Natural Language Understanding and Generation.

            are just focussing on generating scientific abstracts. I started off on the project by doing a lot of
            literature surveys and built a <strong>few initial Attention based baselines</strong>. More recently, I have been working on 
            making <strong>novel architectural changes to a Sequence to Sequence model</strong> called the Writing Editing Network.

            Worked under Prof. Premkumar Natarajan in the capacity of a student worker. I was a part of the team that started off reasearch efforts on a new project on Neural Query based Abstractive Text Summarization. As a part of the research group I got a chance to foray into the field of Deep Learning. Familiarized myself with internal workings of a <strong>Feed Forward Neural Network and also learnt about RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs</strong>. Did a lot of literature survey and successfully ran the Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Summarization (NAMAS) by Facebook.

                        I coded two perceptron based classifiers for hotel review classification task as a part of
                        the Applied NLP's coursework @USC. The dataset is the same as
                        that of the NaÃ®ve Bayes Classifier task. I implemented a Vanilla Perceptron and an Averaged Perceptron and 
                        relied on term frequency for features of the model. <strong>The Averaged perceptron based model gave a test set F1
                        score of 0.921</strong>.
