This is a digital portfolio and it was developed using Hyde, which is a 2 column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme. 
I exported all of my posts from Medium and added them to the website and in addition to that, I incorporated 
* Google Analytics 
* Disqus comments 
* Project cards and 
* Experience timeline. 

Hope you like it!
