I’ll be mentioning all the resources and materials that I had used to prepare for my exam. Just to provide myself some credibility, here are my exam scores.</p><blockquote name="5f89" id="5f89" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Quant = 164, Verbal = 155, AWA = 5.0 [GRE]</blockquote><blockquote name="7902" id="7902" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">Reading = 30, Listening = 29, Speaking = 28 and Writing = 30 [TOEFL]</blockquote><p name="002f" id="002f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I spent about 6–8 months to get through these exams. I procrastinated a lot but I did put in a dedicated effort for the last couple of months and I dedicate my score to that effort itself. I did a lot of research on the materials I should use for my preparation and I’ll be providing an extensive list of materials here in this blog post.</p><h3 name="f278" id="f278" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Getting to know the GRE</h3><p name="3e8b" id="3e8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A score of 320+ is considered to be a great score if you are someone like me who has absolutely <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">0 research experience. </strong>It is not really a difficult task to get this score. If you know about the pattern of the exam, you know that students are mostly frightened by the long list of vocabulary words that they have to cram and retain. But fear not, you don’t need to do that to get a great score. Let me first break down the exam into various components for you.</p><p name="b742" id="b742" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The exam has a total of 4 sections apart and 2 essay writing sections. 2 Quant, 2 verbal sections and 2 essays. The essays are Issue Essay and the Argument Essay.</p><p name="0d35" id="0d35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Issue Essay (30 minutes), Argument Essay(30 minutes), 2 * Quant (25 questions in 35 minutes), 2 * Verbal (20 questions in 30 minutes) amounts to about 3 hours and 10 minutes. There is a 15 minutes break after your AWA and 2 other sections. AWA is the first section on the GRE and you cannot skip forward before attempting this section.</p><p name="addc" id="addc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just when you think that after a strenuous 3 hours of sitting, you’ll sail off into the sunset with a great score, the ETS guys tell you to</p><figure name="15f1" id="15f1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 630px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 90%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aaiZIbm7foPFbckanBzAag.png" data-width="1000" data-height="900" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aaiZIbm7foPFbckanBzAag.png"></div></figure><p name="4ead" id="4ead" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">ETS also has a research section waiting for you somewhere in the exam. It can be either verbal or quant and the BEST (worst ;P) part is that you don’t know which section on the test is the research section. So as a student, you have to give your level best in every section. That makes the GRE a 4 hour beast of an exam that requires a lot of focus and will to get through.</p><p name="697f" id="697f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The test is adaptive , the next question will be supposedly tougher or easier based on how you attempted the previous questions.</p><h3 name="d6cc" id="d6cc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Verbal Question Types</h3><p name="46a1" id="46a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The verbal section consists of various question types. These are</p><ul class="postList"><li name="926b" id="926b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Sentence Equivalence</li><li name="39cb" id="39cb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Text Completion</li><li name="cdbe" id="cdbe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reading Comprehension and</li><li name="6c23" id="6c23" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Paragraph Argument.</li></ul><p name="b85e" id="b85e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">I won’t be providing the details for each of these questions in this blog post. Such details can easily be found on <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/content/" data-href="https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/content/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ETS’s website</a>. The Text completion is further of three types.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f871" id="f871" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Single Blank</li><li name="9b8a" id="9b8a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Double Blank and</li><li name="bcb1" id="bcb1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Triple Blank text completion.</li></ul><p name="e875" id="e875" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">For me, the Reading Comprehension is the toughest part of the verbal section. Out of the 40 questions you will get in the 2 verbal sections (excluding the research section here), approximately 16 questions are RCs. These need a lot of practice and patience to get through. Especially because of the convoluted text structure often found in the paragraphs.</p><h3 name="fa23" id="fa23" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Quant Question Types</h3><p name="b4ca" id="b4ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The Quant section on the GRE is comprised of 4 major sections</p><ul class="postList"><li name="792b" id="792b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Algebra</li><li name="0f4b" id="0f4b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Geometry</li><li name="9ca7" id="9ca7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Arithmetic</li><li name="f5a3" id="f5a3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Data Analysis.</li></ul><p name="6145" id="6145" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">As a part of these 4 sections, there is a lot of content to be covered. Again, the quant syllabus can be easily found on the ETS website or in the ETS official GRE book. The quant section is comprised of questions which any engineer would have encountered in their 10th class or during their Bachelors. This section is supposedly easier or rather way too easy as opposed to its counterpart, but being overconfident can be surely detrimental to your score. Getting a complete 170 in the Quant section requires a lot of practice and focus .In case you manage to get a perfect quant score, even a smaller verbal score something like 155 would mean a total of 325, which is awesome.</p><h3 name="324e" id="324e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Resources</h3><p name="5c14" id="5c14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The primary resource</strong> I would pick up any day of the week for Verbal prep is <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Word-Power-Made-Norman-Lewis/dp/8183071007?tag=googinhydr18418-21&amp;tag=googinkenshoo-21&amp;ascsubtag=43b85d9f-fcbb-4d2f-8c7c-15ee667692bb" data-href="http://www.amazon.in/Word-Power-Made-Norman-Lewis/dp/8183071007?tag=googinhydr18418-21&amp;tag=googinkenshoo-21&amp;ascsubtag=43b85d9f-fcbb-4d2f-8c7c-15ee667692bb" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Word Power Made Easy by Normal Lewis.</a> The book does not contain a lot of GRE words, however, it does strive to make you fall in love with <a href="https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=etymology" data-href="https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=etymology" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">etymology</a> and vocabulary in particular. After completing the book you will know how to identify words by their roots. This should be done if you have &gt; 2 months in hand for your preparation. If not, you can skip this.</p></div></div></section><section name="cefa" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="eab4" id="eab4" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Next resource</strong> I would recommend is the <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/gre-official-guide-revised-general-test/p/itme9tex8ch4m6au?gclid=CP3Z0rOwhNICFcGOaAodoigJKw&amp;pid=9780071791236&amp;cmpid=content_book_8965229628_gmc_pla&amp;tgi=sem%2C1%2CG%2C11214002%2Cg%2Csearch%2C%2C170219493259%2C1o2%2C%2C%2Cc%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C&amp;s_kwcid=AL%21739%213%21170219493259%21%21%21g%2151320962143%21&amp;ef_id=WJ0XaQAAAB84RA1Y%3A20170210012913%3As" data-href="https://www.flipkart.com/gre-official-guide-revised-general-test/p/itme9tex8ch4m6au?gclid=CP3Z0rOwhNICFcGOaAodoigJKw&amp;pid=9780071791236&amp;cmpid=content_book_8965229628_gmc_pla&amp;tgi=sem%2C1%2CG%2C11214002%2Cg%2Csearch%2C%2C170219493259%2C1o2%2C%2C%2Cc%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C&amp;s_kwcid=AL%21739%213%21170219493259%21%21%21g%2151320962143%21&amp;ef_id=WJ0XaQAAAB84RA1Y%3A20170210012913%3As" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ETS Official GRE Book</a>.

The Magoosh guys charged around 7–8k INR for a period of 6 months and their questions and content are way better than the Jambooree ones. I guess anyone looking to join classes over the weekend or something for GRE prep should rather take up the online offering by Magoosh. You won’t repent this decision.</p><p name="c141" id="c141" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They have around 1000 questions for practice.

The exam does not directly ask the meaning of difficult words. This is not something they like to test. So cramming up huge word lists will do you no good. There are a number of word lists available online like Barron’s and Kaplan’s Flashcards, however, cramming them up is equivalent to not doing anything at all.</p><p name="161f" id="161f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">What the GRE is interested in testing is your ability to comprehend the meaning of the content in-front of you and then answer the question. They test your ability to understand the meaning of the given sentence or paragraph. Sure, knowing the definition of the words really helps, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. You need to understand the usage of the word in various contexts as well.</p></div></div></section><section name="d21f" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="fd70" id="fd70" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><a href="https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary/decks" data-href="https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary/decks" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Magoosh Flashcards</a> have provided a great vocabulary flashcards application that lets you learn the words along with a sentence effectively.

RC is a tough beast to conquer and the only way to do this is by reading a lot of good prose. I’m not talking about fiction novels like Harry Potter etc. I’m talking about difficult prose that you would otherwise never read during your leisure time. Something like art, culture, governments, novel reviews, poetry reviews.

This is a list of steps generally followed for writing the issue essay.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="eabc" id="eabc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Brainstorm.</li><li name="4bec" id="4bec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Pick a side by writing down points (bullet shorthand points on rough sheet) for each side.</li><li name="1557" id="1557" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You need 3 body paragraphs, 1 introduction and 1 conclusion. 2 paragraphs are usually for addressing the side you choose and 1 is for addressing the opposite side. So choose your sides accordingly.</li><li name="2630" id="2630" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Start with the introduction (if you can come up with one without waisting much time.)</li><li name="7289" id="7289" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Write the 3 body paragraphs.</li><li name="3b04" id="3b04" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Finally, the conclusion.</li><li name="72d2" id="72d2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Proofread the essay because there are no spellcheckers in the software to rectify spelling mistakes.</li></ol><p name="3b33" id="3b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It is also best to follow some sort of a template for both the essays. <a href="https://crunchprep.com/gre-analytical-writing-guide" data-href="https://crunchprep.com/gre-analytical-writing-guide" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crunchprep</a> provides an amazing blog covering each and every aspect of the AWA and they also provide templates for both the essays. Use the template and modify according to the topic at hand. Do not cram the template up and write it word for word. That will count as plagiarism as a lot of other students might also be doing the same.</p><h4 name="237e" id="237e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Argument Essay</h4><p name="8fe0" id="8fe0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The argument essay is comparatively easier than the issue essay. Here, a certain argument paragraph is provided and the reader needs to find out the assumptions in the argument and write up an essay pointing out these assumptions that the author makes. There are many different types of assumptions usually encountered in an argument essay paragraph and the crunchprep blog covers everything up very well.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="50ec" id="50ec" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Brainstorm to find out the assumptions. Write down mini points on the rough sheet.</li><li name="8cbd" id="8cbd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Begin with the introduction. Mention that the argument is flawed and thus the conclusion doesn’t hold true.</li><li name="ae35" id="ae35" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Write up 2–3 body paragraphs providing the various assumptions that weaken the argument.</li><li name="ab4f" id="ab4f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Remember to provide rectification for these missing pieces at the end of every body paragraph. Something like <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">“If additional survey had been done with a large sample of people, the argument would have been much more convincing”</em></li><li name="fd24" id="fd24" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Write up the conclusion and do not introduce any new point here. Just summarise what all you have written in the previous paragraphs.</li></ol><h3 name="23dd" id="23dd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Gmat AWA</h3><p name="4409" id="4409" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There is no free service out there that matches the level of <a href="http://gmatawa.com" data-href="http://gmatawa.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GMAT AWA</a> for scoring your essays.
