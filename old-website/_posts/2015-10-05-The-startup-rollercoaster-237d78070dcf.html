Let me rephrase it. Startups are really interesting. From the small idea you have over beer to prepping demos for the product, to pitching the product to investors, to receiving the funds for your product, to seeing your startup getting acclaimed by the investors and clients; It is in fact a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">roller coaster ride.</strong></p><p name="1d9a" id="1d9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I really thought that working for a startup is a risky affair and it is always better to work for a big and well established company. However my perception changed greatly when I joined a startup myself ( not an early stage startup but a very successful one ). Over a period of 3–4 months I realised what is so special about a startup that people cherish. What is it that inspires people to give up big juicy packages and work on an early stage product which might even fail in the market.</p><p name="3aa1" id="3aa1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the founders it is obviously an interesting venture as it is their idea, their baby and they want to get their product, their idea in the market as soon as possible. They think they can solve a problem we face on a daily basis and this is what keeps them motivated. As for the people who become a part of the journey later on, I figured out, it is the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">wealth of knowledge </strong>that seems very flashy and that is what attracts them. People say that we get to learn so much working in a startup as compared to if we would work for a bigger established firm and this is true IMHO. We get exposed to a vast pool of technologies that we haven’t even heard of while working for a startup and that too in a very short span of time. One of the best perks of working for a startup is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">experimentation. </strong>You can experiment a lot with the newer technologies and propose changes to the current architecture as well.</p><p name="531d" id="531d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I won’t be focussing on the perks of working for a startup. Everybody knows that and that is why most of the graduates today either want to join a startup or start one of their own.</p><figure name="516e" id="516e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 652px; max-height: 304px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 46.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*u0Fxo1_zLpxPYsidmBT2Sw.jpeg" data-width="652" data-height="304" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*u0Fxo1_zLpxPYsidmBT2Sw.jpeg"></div></figure><blockquote name="6d04" id="6d04" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--figure">Translation :- When the graduates of this country get bored of their 9–5 jobs, they only have 3 ways out IAS, MBA or Startup.</blockquote><p name="5586" id="5586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I guess this is the most apt explanation for the current state of affairs of graduates (at least in India). I just want to focus on one specific problem that I and possibly other people working in a startup might face.</p><p name="6d31" id="6d31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You cannot truly get matured in using a technology unless you don’t fail or rather miserably fail at it. Yes, our mentors can guide us. Yes, our mentors can tell us the best practices to follow. They can tell us how a DB schema should be for specific problems. They can tell us how the architecture can be scaled. They can tell us how the micro services design pattern is a great one. We can try and remember all this stuff, but ultimately it will slip out of our minds.</p><p name="490e" id="490e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason for this is that we can’t really <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">mug </em></strong>up the internals of a technology. We can only get better at stuff with experience. So although getting exposed to too many technologies at once seems to be very flashy and interesting (it is actually ;)) , you can’t really say that you are an expert at it unless you get your hands dirty and that takes time.</p><p name="981c" id="981c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I am suggesting is that instead of trying and exploring each and every small piece of tech being used in your team / squad, just try and focus on the project you currently are working on and the software and technologies involved in it. Just try and explore one technology at a time and the stuff you explore will only come in handy if you are actually using it to build something. It can be a side project or your current project at the company. Then after a certain point of time you can truly claim to be an expert at that technology and that is actually much much better. Don’t try your hands at <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">everything you come across. Stick to one thing at a time !</strong></p><p name="d307" id="d307" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Happy Coding !! :)</p></div></div></section>
